Supplies Needed Heat Press Supplies Heating Element 12v 220c At least a 3amp 12v power supply ($10.00~) Door Hinge (~$2.00) Piece of wood JB Weld High Heat ($8.00) Printer Supplies Needed Dye Sub Printer (~$200) Heat Resistant Tape Instructions Print pictures Cut pictures out Attach picture to front of cap using heat tape Turn on heating element and let it heat up Place small silicone on heating element, silicone should be cut so that it touches as much of the cap surface as possible. Place cap on the silicone and press down on the wood arm for 30-50 seconds. Remove one side of the tape and check image, if it's not done you can put the tape back carfully and heat it again. Remember to turn off your heating element! Done! Visual Walkthrough Other Tips Notes I use a size of 1.1cm x 1.1cm for the pictures I put on caps. Cherry Profile keycaps can be a little taller but this works for DSA and SA. Remember to print them mirrored. I still have a bunch of paper and ink so if there is interest I can provide a printing service, you would send me the pictures in the right size and I would print them for a small fee and ship them to you.
